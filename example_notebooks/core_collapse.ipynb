    "Eventually, all SIDM halos should undergoe core collapse. The timescale for this process depends on the strength of the interaction cross section and other processes like tidal stripping. Depending on these factors, it can be much longer than, comparable, or shorter than the age of the Universe. \n",

    "Nishikawa et al. 2020 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00499.pdf) track SIDM halos in the field, and compare their evolution with subhalos with similar physical properties. They find that isolated halos in the field build up their cores until t \\sim 50*t0, and then begin to contract until $t = 350 t_0$. On the other hand, a tidally truncated halo builds up a core until $t \\sim 5 t_0$, and core collapse occurs by $t = 20-50 t_0$, depending on exactly how long the halo exists in the tidal field. We will consider characteristic core collapse time scales of $20 t_0$ and $200 t_0$ for subhalos and field halos, respectively. "
